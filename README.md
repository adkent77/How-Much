# What is How-Much?  

My position in any organization is unique. On a given project, I may be exposed to any domain from business development, to engineering, to content creation and management. 

How-Much is a **very simple** development project for an **extremely basic** web-based weather application. The purpose of this is project is to demonstrate my unique abilities to: 

* Research audiences and products.
* Advocate for products and clients in the agile scrum development process.
* Review, develop, and improve API technical documentation.
* Develop basic features in HTML, CSS, and Java.
* Use a REST API to retrieve data. 

The iterative code for **How-Much** provides a **rudimentary** example scenario of a scrum/agile development environment for a weather application that uses a web-based API. 

# Scenario

I'm from a snowy area of the United States. When you grow up in a place that snows a lot, you learn how hard it is to shovel snow. When you shovel a lot of snow, you learn the value of understanding **how much** snow it is that you have to shovel, rather than **how likely** it is that you will have to shovel. When the weather forecast says there's a chance of snow, it doesn't really help you that much. You live in a snowy area. As long as it's a winter month, you _know_ there is a chance of snow. It's much better to know **how much** snow is coming. After the snow arrives, you have to move it out of your way. Is it hard to move? Depends **how much**.

In an agile scrum development environment, engineers work with product managers to create software solutions to serve needs that the marketplace demands. Product managers describe feature requirements to engineers. Engineers develop tools to meet product manager specifications. Project managers liase between product managers and engineers to communicate goals, organize work, update schedules, and track progress for the entire team.

I took Tom Johnson's [Documentating APIs course](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) to prepare for more API-based, developer-facing technical documentation projects. Tom used an actual REST API to retrieve [weather conditions for Santa Clara, CA](https://idratherbewriting.com/assets/files/wind-openweathermap.html). I realized I can modify this product to solve a need.
